This script implements a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) designed to assess the urgency of a patient's need for medical attention based on three inputs: age, temperature, and headache severity. The urgency is evaluated on a scale from 0 (non-urgent) to 100 (urgent).

Features:
- Input data (integer or interval) for age, temperature, and headache severity.
- Membership function visualisation for each input and output.
- Implementation of both Mamdani and TSK inference methods.
- Defuzzification using multiple techniques (centroid, bisector, mean of maxima, minimum of                                                                                                                                        maxima, max of maxima, zero-order TSK, and first-order TSK).
- Float values are accepted.

Requirements:
- python3
- Import MatPlotLib, Numpy, and SKFuzzy in order to run the python files

to install libraries:
- pip install matplotlib numpy scikit-fuzzy
- this step may not be necessary for users working on an anaconda distribution of python

Usage:
- Run the script in a Python environment
- Follow the prompts from the command line to enter patient details. Multiple patients can be added if the user wishes, just follow the prompt. Type "n" if this isnt needed.
- Since the program will display multiple outputs unless specified otherwise - please enter "Y" if you would like to view a simplified output sheet.
- Review the generated plots and console outputs for text descriptions of the graphs

Input parameters single:
- Age: Value between 0 and 130.
- Temperature: Celsius value between 0 - 100.
- Headache: Rate the severity on a scale 0 - 10. 

Input parameters interval:
- Age: 2 age values (in years) between 0 and 120.
- Temperature: 2 Celsius temperature value between 0 - 100.
- Headache: 2 values between 0 - 10.
